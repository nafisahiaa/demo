 <b>A little history.</b><br> Until 1947, Bangladesh used to be part of India and was known as “East Bengal”. In 1947 when India gained independence from British colonial rule, the sub-continent was also partitioned into India and Pakistan, leading to the largest migration crisis in history. 14 million people became refugees as many Hindu families moved from Pakistan to India and Muslims from India to Pakistan. Bangladesh was known as “East Pakistan” and was governed from Islamabad in (West) Pakistan – something that was unpopular with many Bangladeshis. In 1971 Bangladesh (with the support of India) fought Pakistan for independence and became the independent country of Bangladesh that it is today.
